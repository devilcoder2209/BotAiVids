# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains automated workflows for the BotAiVids application.

## Available Workflows

### deploy.yml - Production Deployment

**Triggers**:
- Automatically when code is pushed to the `main` branch
- Manually from the GitHub Actions tab

**What It Does**:
1. **Quality Check** - Verifies code quality and checks for errors
2. **Deploy** - Triggers deployment to Render
3. **Health Check** - Confirms the application is running

**Duration**: Approximately 3-5 minutes total

## Workflow File Structure

### Jobs Overview

```
quality-check (Job 1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Checkout code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Set up Python 3.10
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Install dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Check for syntax errors
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Verify required files exist
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Test Python imports

deploy (Job 2, runs after Job 1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Checkout code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Trigger Render deployment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Wait for deployment to start
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Check application health
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Display deployment summary
```

## Configuration

### Required Secrets

These must be configured in GitHub repository settings:

- **RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK**: The deploy hook URL from Render
  - Location to add: Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
  - How to get: Render Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Deploy Hook

### Environment Variables

The workflow uses:
- `PYTHON_VERSION`: Set to '3.10' (matches production environment)

## How to Modify

### Change Python Version

Edit `deploy.yml`:
```yaml
env:
  PYTHON_VERSION: '3.11'  # Change to desired version
```

### Add Additional Checks

Add a new step under `quality-check` job:
```yaml
- name: Your new check
  run: |
    # Your commands here
```

### Modify Health Check Timeout

Edit the `MAX_ATTEMPTS` in the health check step:
```yaml
MAX_ATTEMPTS=10  # Change to desired number of attempts
# Each attempt waits 15 seconds, so 10 attempts = 150 seconds
```

### Change Deployment Trigger

To deploy from multiple branches, modify:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, staging ]  # Add more branches
```

## Monitoring Deployments

### View Workflow Runs
1. Go to repository ‚Üí Actions tab
2. Click on a workflow run to see details
3. Click on a job to see step-by-step logs

### Workflow Status
- ‚úÖ Green = All steps passed
- ‚ùå Red = At least one step failed
- üü° Yellow = Currently running
- ‚ö™ Gray = Waiting or skipped

## Manual Deployment

You can manually trigger deployment:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy to Production" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose branch (usually `main`)
5. Click green "Run workflow" button

This is useful when:
- You updated Render environment variables
- You want to redeploy without code changes
- You're testing the deployment process

## Troubleshooting Workflows

### Workflow Not Running

**Check**:
- Is the workflow file in `.github/workflows/` directory?
- Is the file named with `.yml` or `.yaml` extension?
- Are GitHub Actions enabled? (Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General)

### Quality Check Failing

**Common Causes**:
- Python syntax errors in code
- Missing required files (app.py, main.py, etc.)
- Import errors due to missing dependencies

**How to Fix**:
1. Read the error logs in the failed step
2. Test imports locally: `python -c "import app"`
3. Fix the issues and push again

### Deploy Job Not Running

**Possible Reasons**:
- Quality check failed (deploy won't run if quality check fails)
- Push was to a branch other than `main`
- Deploy job is configured to skip on certain conditions

**Check**:
- Did quality check pass?
- Are you on the `main` branch?

### Deployment Triggered But Failed

**Causes**:
- Missing or incorrect `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK` secret
- Render service is paused or deleted
- Network connectivity issues

**How to Fix**:
1. Verify secret is set correctly in GitHub
2. Check Render dashboard to ensure service is active
3. Try manual deployment to test

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
‚úÖ Good: "Add image upload validation to prevent large files"
‚úÖ Good: "Fix database connection timeout issue"
‚ùå Avoid: "update"
‚ùå Avoid: "fix bug"
```

### Testing Before Push
Always test locally before pushing:
```powershell
# Test imports
python -c "import app"
python -c "import main"

# Run the application
python main.py

# Test in browser
# Visit http://localhost:5000
```

### Branch Strategy
- `main` branch = Production code (auto-deploys)
- Feature branches = Development (no auto-deploy)
- Create Pull Requests to merge features into main

### Monitoring
- Check Actions tab after pushing
- Wait for green checkmarks before considering deploy successful
- If red X appears, click it to see what failed

## Workflow Metrics

Typical execution times:
- **Checkout code**: 5-10 seconds
- **Set up Python**: 10-20 seconds
- **Install dependencies**: 30-60 seconds (cached)
- **Quality checks**: 20-30 seconds
- **Trigger deployment**: 5 seconds
- **Health check**: 30-150 seconds
- **Total**: 3-5 minutes

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- Never hardcode sensitive values in workflow files
- Always use GitHub secrets for API keys and deploy hooks
- Secrets are encrypted and not visible in logs

### Permissions
The workflow has permissions to:
- Read repository code
- Trigger Render deployments
- Post status checks

It cannot:
- Modify repository settings
- Access other repositories
- Perform destructive operations

## Extending the Workflow

### Add Testing
To add automated tests:
```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    pip install pytest
    pytest tests/
```

### Add Code Linting
To enforce code style:
```yaml
- name: Lint with flake8
  run: |
    pip install flake8
    flake8 . --count --max-line-length=127 --statistics
```

### Add Notifications
To get notified of deployment results, you can integrate:
- Slack notifications
- Discord webhooks
- Email alerts
- GitHub Discussions posts

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues with the workflows:
1. Check the detailed logs in the Actions tab
2. Review the main `CICD_SETUP.md` guide
3. Verify all secrets are configured correctly
4. Ensure Render service is active and accessible
